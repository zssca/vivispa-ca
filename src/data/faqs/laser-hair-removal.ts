      question: "How does laser hair removal work?",      
      answer: "Laser hair removal works by targeting the pigment in the hair follicle with concentrated light energy. The light is converted to heat, which damages the hair follicle and inhibits future hair growth."    
    },
  {
      question: "Is laser hair removal permanent?",      
      answer: "Laser hair removal provides long-term hair reduction. Most clients experience a significant reduction in hair growth after a complete series of treatments, with any remaining hair typically being lighter and finer."    
    },
  {
      question: "How many sessions will I need?",      
      answer: "Most clients require 6-8 treatments spaced 4-6 weeks apart for optimal results. The exact number depends on the treatment area, hair type, and individual factors."    
    },
  {
      question: "Is laser hair removal painful?",      
      answer: "Most clients describe the sensation as a mild stinging or snapping feeling. Our advanced cooling systems and adjustable settings ensure maximum comfort during treatment."    
    },
  {
      question: "What areas can be treated with laser hair removal?",      
      answer: "Laser hair removal can treat virtually any area of the body where unwanted hair grows, including the face, underarms, arms, legs, back, bikini area, and chest."    
    },
  {
      question: "How should I prepare for a laser hair removal session?",
