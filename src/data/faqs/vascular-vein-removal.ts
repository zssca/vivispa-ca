      question: "How does vascular vein removal work?",
      answer: "Our vascular vein removal treatment uses advanced laser technology that targets the hemoglobin in blood vessels with specific wavelengths of light. The light energy converts to heat, causing the vessel walls to collapse while leaving surrounding tissue unharmed. The body then naturally reabsorbs the treated vessels."
    },
  {
      question: "Is vascular vein removal painful?",
      answer: "Most clients describe the sensation as similar to a rubber band snap against the skin. Our equipment includes cooling technology to minimize discomfort during the procedure. For clients with lower pain thresholds, a topical numbing cream can be applied before the treatment."
    },
  {
      question: "How many treatments will I need?",
      answer: "The number of treatments varies depending on the size, color, and location of the vascular lesions. Facial veins often show improvement after 1-2 sessions, while leg veins typically require 3-6 treatments spaced 4-6 weeks apart for optimal results."
    },
  {
      question: "What kinds of vascular lesions can be treated?",
      answer: "Our treatments can address a variety of vascular concerns including spider veins (telangiectasias), cherry angiomas, broken capillaries, facial redness, and certain port wine stains. During your consultation, we'll evaluate your specific condition and recommend the most appropriate treatment approach."
    },
  {
      question: "What should I expect after the treatment?",
      answer: "After treatment, the targeted vessels may appear darker or change color, indicating successful treatment. Some redness, swelling, or a sensation similar to a mild sunburn may occur temporarily. These effects typically resolve within 24-48 hours. For leg vein treatments, we may recommend wearing compression stockings to support the healing process."
    },
  {
      question: "Are the results permanent?",
      answer: "Vascular vein removal permanently eliminates the treated blood vessels. However, it doesn't prevent new vessels from forming over time due to genetic predisposition, hormonal changes, or lifestyle factors. Maintaining results may require occasional maintenance treatments and following recommendations for vein health."
