  {
      question: "What is microneedling?",
      answer: "Microneedling is a minimally invasive cosmetic procedure that uses fine needles to create thousands of tiny, invisible puncture wounds in the top layer of skin. This process stimulates the skin's natural wound healing process, increasing collagen and elastin production."
    },
  {
      question: "Is microneedling painful?",
      answer: "Most clients experience minimal discomfort. We apply a topical numbing cream before the procedure to ensure comfort during treatment."
    },
  {
      question: "How long does it take to see results?",
      answer: "Some clients notice an immediate glow, but visible improvements in skin texture and tone typically appear within 2-4 weeks as collagen production increases. The full results can take up to 6 months to appear."
    },
  {
      question: "How many sessions will I need?",
      answer: "For optimal results, we typically recommend a series of 3-6 treatments spaced 4-6 weeks apart, depending on your specific skin concerns."
    },
  {
      question: "What is the downtime after microneedling?",
      answer: "Most clients experience mild redness and sensitivity similar to a sunburn for 24-48 hours after treatment. You can typically resume normal activities within a day or two."
    },
  {
      question: "What skin concerns can microneedling address?",
      answer: "Microneedling effectively treats fine lines, wrinkles, acne scars, hyperpigmentation, enlarged pores, uneven skin texture, and can even help with stretch marks in certain areas."
