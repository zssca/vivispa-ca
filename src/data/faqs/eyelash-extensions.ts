  {
      question: "What are eyelash extensions?",
      answer: "Eyelash extensions are semi-permanent fibers that are attached to your natural lashes to enhance length, curl, fullness, and thickness."
    },
  {
      question: "How long do eyelash extensions last?",
      answer: "With proper care, lash extensions typically last for the full growth cycle of natural lashes, about 6-8 weeks. We recommend maintenance fills every 2-3 weeks to maintain a full look."
    },
  {
      question: "How should I care for my lash extensions?",
      answer: "Avoid oil-based products and mascara, do not use eyelash curlers, avoid rubbing your eyes, and gently cleanse around the eyes. We provide detailed aftercare instructions after your appointment."
    },
  { 
      question: "Can I wear mascara with them?", 
      answer: "You don't need mascara with eyelash extensions, but if you want to, we suggest using a water-based one. Oil-based products can break down the adhesive and shorten the life of your extensions." 
    },
  { 
      question: "How long does application take?", 
      answer: "Getting eyelash extensions takes about 1 to 2 hours for a full set. It depends on how full you want them and the style you choose." 
    },
  { 
      question: "Are they damaging to natural lashes?", 
      answer: "When applied correctly by our trained professionals, eyelash extensions won't damage your natural lashes. We carefully attach each extension to ensure your natural lashes remain healthy and strong."
