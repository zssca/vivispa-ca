      question: "How does laser skin tightening work?",
      answer: "Laser skin tightening uses infrared light energy to heat the collagen under the skin's surface, causing immediate contraction and long-term collagen production, which improves skin firmness and elasticity."
    },
  {
      question: "What areas can be treated?",
      answer: "Laser skin tightening can be performed on multiple areas, including the face, neck, jawline, abdomen, arms, and thighs."
    },
  {
      question: "How many treatments will I need?",
      answer: "Most clients achieve optimal results with a series of 3-6 treatments spaced 3-4 weeks apart, followed by maintenance treatments every 6-12 months."
    },
  { 
      question: "Is it painful?", 
      answer: "During laser skin tightening, you'll feel some warmth on your skin, but we use cooling to keep it comfortable. Most clients find the treatment very tolerable with minimal discomfort." 
    },
  { 
      question: "Is there downtime?", 
      answer: "No, there's no downtime with non-surgical skin lifting. You can go back to your day right after, with no redness or recovery needed, which makes it convenient for those with busy schedules." 
    },
  { 
      question: "How soon do I see results?", 
      answer: "With laser skin tightening, you'll notice your skin feeling tighter right away. However, the best results develop gradually over 2-3 months as new collagen forms, with continued improvement after each session."
